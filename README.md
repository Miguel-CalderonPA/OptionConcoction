# OptionConcoction

An android app, mean to solve indecision (food places were in mind)

# What I Learned
* Much more kotlin, almost 0 experience beforehand
* UI with ListView, Constraint/Linear Layout, Buttons, EditTexts etc.
* Setup an adapter to fill in list, File I/O, Image movement, user input, add/remove list

# Work in progess
* top 3 still needs to be implemented, just need to set time aside.
